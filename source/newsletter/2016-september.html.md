## Newton Milestone 3 Test Day

Please join us on Thursday and Friday of this week to test the RDO
packages of the Newton milestone 3 release. Milestone 3 released
upstream last week, and we've been packaging and running CI on that
since then. We think Newton is going to be the best release of OpenStack
yet, and we need your help to ensure that this is the case.

We'll be gathering on the #rdo channel on the Freenode IRC network, as
well as posting our findings to the rdo-list mailing list.

For more information about this test day, see the test day web page at
https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/newton/milestone3/

### OpenStack Summit Coming Soon

OpenStack Summit is just a few weeks away - October 25-29 in Barcelona,
Spain - and we would love to see you there. We'll be in the expo hall,
in booth D1, on the right, just inside the main entrance.

If there's something interesting that you've done with RDO that you'd
like to demo at our pod, or if you just want to help answer RDO
questions, please let me know - we'd love to have you as part of our
demo schedule.

You can register for the summit at https://www.openstack.org/summit
