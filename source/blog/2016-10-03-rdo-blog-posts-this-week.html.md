Here's what RDO enthusiasts are blogging about lately.

**Gnocchi 3.0 release** by Julien Danjou

>  After a few weeks of hard work with the team, here is the new major version of  Gnocchi, stamped 3.0.0. It was very  challenging, as we wanted to implement a few big changes in it.

**# of DB connections in OpenStack services** by geguileo

> The other day someone asked me if the SQLAlchemy connections to the DB where per worker or shared among all workers, and what was the number of connections that should be expected from an OpenStack service. Maybe you have also wondered about this at some point, wonder no more, here’s a quick write up summarizing […]

**OVS 2.6 and The First Release of OVN** by russellbryant

> In January of 2015, the Open vSwitch team announced that they planned to start a new project within OVS called OVN (Open Virtual Network).  The timing could not have been better for me as I was looking around for a new project.  I dove in with a goal of figuring out whether OVN could be a promising next generation of Open vSwitch integration for OpenStack and have been contributing to it ever since.

Then you are in luck!, because thanks to Ceph’s new RBD mirroring functionality and Jon Bernard’s work on Cinder, you can now have the […]

**Distinct RBAC Policy Rules** by Adam Young

> The ever elusive bug 968696 is still out there, due, in no small part, to the distributed nature of the policy mechanism. One Question I asked myself as I chased this beastie is “how many distinct policy rules do we actually have to implement?” This is an interesting question because, if we can an automated way to answer that question, it can lead to an automated way to transforming the policy rules themselves, and thus getting to a more unified approach to policy.    The set of policy files used in a Tripleo overcloud have around 1400 rules:

**Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Tesora Database-as-a-Service Platform: What’s New** by Rob Young, Principal Product Manager, Red Hat

>  As OpenStack users build or migrate more applications and services for private cloud deployment, users are expanding their plans for how these deployments will be serviced by non-core, emerging components. Based on the           April 2016 OpenStack User Survey         (see page 35), Trove is among the top “as a service” non-core components that OpenStack users are deploying or plan to deploy on top of the core components. This comes as no surprise as every application requires a database and Trove provides OpenStack with an integrated Database-as-a-Service option that works smoothly with the core OpenStack services.

**Integrating Red Hat Virtualization and Red Hat OpenStack Platform with Neutron Networking** by CaptainKVM

> As applications are designed, redesigned, or even simply thought about at a high level, we frequently think about technical barriers along side business needs. Business needs may dictate that a new architecture move forward, but technical limitations can sometimes counter how far forward – unless there is something to bridge the gap. The new Neutron network integration between Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) and Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) provides such a bridge for business and technical solutions.

**Red Hat Confirms Over 40+ Accepted Sessions at OpenStack Summit Barcelona** by Jeff Jameson, Sr. Principal Product Marketing Manager

>  This Fall’s 2016 OpenStack Summit in Barcelona, Spain is gearing up to be a fulfilling event. After some challenging issues with the voting system (which prevented direct URLs to each session), the Foundation has posted the final session agenda detailing the entire week’s schedule of events. Once again, I am thrilled to see the voting results of the greater community with Red Hat sharing over 40 sessions of technology overview and deep dive’s around OpenStack services for containers, storage, networking, compute, network functions virtualization (NFV), and much more.
